# Row transposition cipher

Implement a row transpositon cipher

For the encrypiton part, the program take two inputs 1) Message M 2) A word w of length k. 

The number of columns in the row transposition matrix will be k, and the columns in the matrix will be read in the alphabetical order of the letters in w. 

The program then create the row transposition matrix and create the encrypted message C.

For the decriyption part, the program take two inputs 1) Encrypted Message C 2) The word w of length k that was used in encrypting the message. 

The program then create the row transposition matrix and create the decrypted message M.
